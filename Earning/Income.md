## livable annual income

cost of living for a single person in New Jersey in 2025

* **Cost of Living:** New Jersey has a cost of living approximately 19.8% higher than the national average as of early 2025. Housing is a major factor, being about 30% higher than the U.S. average.
* **MIT Living Wage Calculation:** According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, the estimated living wage for a single adult in New Jersey is **\$26.20 per hour**. This calculates to an annual income of approximately **\$54,503** before taxes, based on a full-time work year. This wage covers basic necessities but may not include savings, debt repayment, or unexpected expenses.
* **"Comfortable" Lifestyle Estimates:** Studies suggest a considerably higher income is needed for a comfortable lifestyle. One study from early 2025 indicates a single person in New Jersey would need around **\$103,002 annually** to live comfortably. Another study points to a slightly lower figure of **\$54,503** as the required annual income before taxes for just basic needs.
* **Median Rent and the 30% Rule:** The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New Jersey in early 2025 is around \$2,016 per month. Following the 30% rule (spending no more than 30% of gross income on rent), an individual would need to earn approximately **\$80,640 per year** to afford this without financial strain.
* **ALICE Household Survival Budget:** The ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) Project estimates that a single adult in New Jersey needs an annual income of **\$34,644** for a bare-bones survival budget as of their latest assessment. Their "Stability Budget," which includes modest savings and more realistic expenses, rises to **\$57,048** annually.

**Therefore, while the basic "living wage" for a single person in New Jersey in 2025 to cover minimum necessities is estimated to be around \$54,503 before taxes, an income closer to \$80,000 to \$103,000 annually would likely be needed to live more comfortably and without significant financial strain, especially considering the high cost of housing in the state.**

Keep in mind that these are estimates, and the actual livable income can vary based on individual spending habits, location within New Jersey (some areas are more expensive than others), and lifestyle.
