## 1. Maximize Your Current Income:

* Negotiate your salary: Don't underestimate your value. Research industry benchmarks and confidently negotiate for raises and promotions.
* Performance-based bonuses: Aim for roles with bonus structures tied to company performance or specific achievements.
* Equity and stock options: Inquire about equity or stock options, especially in startups or growing companies. These can become very valuable over time.

## livable annual income

cost of living for a single person in New Jersey in 2025

* **Cost of Living:** New Jersey has a cost of living approximately 19.8% higher than the national average as of early 2025. Housing is a major factor, being about 30% higher than the U.S. average.
* **MIT Living Wage Calculation:** According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, the estimated living wage for a single adult in New Jersey is **\$26.20 per hour**. This calculates to an annual income of approximately **\$54,503** before taxes, based on a full-time work year. This wage covers basic necessities but may not include savings, debt repayment, or unexpected expenses.
* **"Comfortable" Lifestyle Estimates:** Studies suggest a considerably higher income is needed for a comfortable lifestyle. One study from early 2025 indicates a single person in New Jersey would need around **\$103,002 annually** to live comfortably. Another study points to a slightly lower figure of **\$54,503** as the required annual income before taxes for just basic needs.
* **Median Rent and the 30% Rule:** The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New Jersey in early 2025 is around \$2,016 per month. Following the 30% rule (spending no more than 30% of gross income on rent), an individual would need to earn approximately **\$80,640 per year** to afford this without financial strain.
* **ALICE Household Survival Budget:** The ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) Project estimates that a single adult in New Jersey needs an annual income of **\$34,644** for a bare-bones survival budget as of their latest assessment. Their "Stability Budget," which includes modest savings and more realistic expenses, rises to **\$57,048** annually.

**Therefore, while the basic "living wage" for a single person in New Jersey in 2025 to cover minimum necessities is estimated to be around \$54,503 before taxes, an income closer to \$80,000 to \$103,000 annually would likely be needed to live more comfortably and without significant financial strain, especially considering the high cost of housing in the state.**

Keep in mind that these are estimates, and the actual livable income can vary based on individual spending habits, location within New Jersey (some areas are more expensive than others), and lifestyle.

## US Class Distinctions and Income Brackets

![Socioeconomic Classes](<static/US Class Distinctions and Income Brackets.jpeg>)

Classism in personal finance

A cynic might scoff at "life is what you make of it" because it oversimplifies complex realities. The phrase implies personal effort alone shapes outcomes, ignoring systemic barriers, luck, or circumstances beyond control—like economic hardship, health issues, or social inequities. To them, it sounds like naive optimism or a dismissive platitude, blaming individuals for systemic failures. Sarcasm would be their way of rejecting this perceived oversimplification, mocking the idea that sheer willpower can conquer all obstacles.

**1. Assumptions about resources and starting points:**

* **"Pull yourself up by your bootstraps" mentality:** Many personal finance narratives assume a baseline level of income, savings, and access to resources that simply isn't a reality for everyone. Advice often focuses on saving for retirement, investing in the stock market, or buying a home, which are difficult or impossible without disposable income and a stable financial foundation.
* **Ignoring systemic barriers:** Financial advice often overlooks the systemic inequalities (like stagnant wages, predatory lending in low-income areas, and unequal access to education and healthcare) that disproportionately affect people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This can make it seem like financial struggles are purely due to individual choices, rather than broader societal issues.
* **"Knowledge of the Hidden Rules of Social Class":** Some frameworks highlight that different social classes operate with different "hidden rules" regarding money, work, and social interactions. Personal finance advice often implicitly assumes a middle-class or upper-class understanding of these rules, making it less accessible or even irrelevant to those from different backgrounds.

**2. Focus on specific types of clients/assets:**

* **High net worth bias:** Traditional financial advising often caters to individuals with significant assets, as this is where advisors earn higher fees. This leaves many people with lower incomes or less wealth underserved or feeling like financial advice isn't "for them."
* **Exclusionary language and jargon:** Financial advice can be filled with complex jargon and concepts that are intimidating and difficult to understand for those without a financial background. This can create a barrier to entry for many.

**3. Lack of representation and trust:**

* **Homogenous financial advisor demographics:** The financial advising industry has historically lacked diversity. People from marginalized backgrounds may find it difficult to connect with advisors who don't understand their unique experiences or who come from a different socioeconomic reality. This can lead to a lack of trust in financial institutions and advisors.
* **Impact of historical discrimination:** Historically, certain groups have been excluded from financial systems or subjected to discriminatory practices (e.g., redlining). This history impacts current trust and access to financial services.

**4. Advice that isn't universally applicable:**

* **Budgeting advice:** While well-intentioned, advice to "cut out your daily latte" can be tone-deaf and unhelpful for someone struggling to afford basic necessities. For many, there's no "fat" to trim in their budget.
* **Investment strategies:** Complex investment strategies presented in books or by advisors may not be appropriate or accessible for those with limited capital or who prioritize immediate financial stability over long-term growth.
* **Debt management:** Advice on debt often doesn't differentiate between "good debt" (like a mortgage) and "bad debt" (like high-interest credit card debt) or acknowledge the structural reasons people accrue debt (e.g., medical emergencies, lack of living wage).

**Examples in books and media:**

While many personal finance books aim to be helpful, some are criticized for:

* **"Rich Dad Poor Dad"**: This book has been critiqued for its anecdotal and sometimes oversimplified advice, and for promoting real estate speculation without adequately addressing the risks or the initial capital required, potentially perpetuating a "get rich quick" mentality that isn't feasible for everyone.
* **Generic budgeting guides:** Some books offer one-size-fits-all budgeting templates that don't account for varying income levels, essential expenses, or financial emergencies common in lower-income households.

In conclusion, while the intention of personal finance advising is often to empower individuals, the underlying assumptions, accessibility issues, and historical context can lead to classist outcomes that reinforce existing wealth disparities. Addressing classism requires a more nuanced, inclusive, and systemic approach to financial education and advising.

## shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations

You're touching upon a widely discussed idea, often summarized by the saying "shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations." This proverb suggests that it typically takes three generations for a family to lose the wealth accumulated by the first generation.

Here's a breakdown of why this "reset" can happen:

**The Builder Generation:**

* **Grit and Sacrifice:** The first generation usually builds wealth through hard work, determination, and often significant personal sacrifice. They have a deep understanding of the value of money because they earned it.
* **Direct Connection to Effort:** They have a strong connection between their labor and their financial success.

**The Steward Generation:**

* **Familiarity but Less Direct Experience:** The second generation often grows up with some awareness of their parents' struggles and the effort involved in creating the wealth. They may have witnessed the sacrifices firsthand.
* **Comfort and Entitlement:** However, they also experience a more comfortable lifestyle and may develop a sense of entitlement simply by virtue of their inheritance.
* **Potential for Poor Management:** Without the same drive or understanding of wealth creation, they might not manage the wealth as effectively, sometimes due to lack of financial literacy or a different set of priorities.

**The Consumer Generation:**

* **Distance from Origin:** The third generation is often the furthest removed from the source of the wealth. They have typically grown up in affluence without experiencing the hardships or understanding the principles that led to its creation.
* **Lack of Appreciation:** They may take the wealth for granted and lack a true appreciation for its value and the effort required to maintain it.
* **Dilution through Inheritance:** As the family grows, the original wealth is often divided among more and more descendants, naturally diluting each individual's share.
* **Different Priorities and Lifestyles:** Their values and lifestyles may differ significantly from the wealth-building generations, leading to spending habits that deplete the inheritance.
* **Lack of Financial Acumen:** They may not have been taught or may not prioritize learning how to manage and grow the wealth effectively.

**However, it's crucial to understand that this "three-generation curse" is not an absolute rule.** Many families successfully preserve and grow their wealth beyond three generations. Here are some factors that can help break this cycle:

* **Financial Education and Literacy:** Educating subsequent generations about wealth management, investing, and the importance of financial responsibility is key.
* **Strong Family Values and Communication:** Establishing clear family values around wealth and fostering open communication about finances can help align goals and expectations.
* **Professional Guidance:** Engaging financial advisors, estate planners, and other professionals can provide expertise in managing and transferring wealth effectively.
* **Instilling a Strong Work Ethic and Purpose:** Encouraging each generation to find their own passions and develop a strong work ethic, independent of the inherited wealth, can provide a sense of purpose and prevent complacency.
* **Creating a Shared Family Legacy:** Focusing on the long-term vision for the family's wealth and instilling a sense of stewardship rather than ownership can encourage responsible management.
* **Strategic Philanthropy:** Engaging in philanthropy can provide a sense of purpose and connect the family's wealth to a larger societal impact.
* **Careful Estate Planning:** Implementing robust estate plans that consider tax implications and provide clear guidelines for wealth transfer can help preserve assets.

So, while there's a historical tendency for wealth to diminish over three generations due to the factors mentioned, it's not an inevitable outcome. With careful planning, education, and a focus on long-term stewardship, families can certainly buck this trend.

## Clickbait claim > 80% of billionaires never went to college

Research from Wealth-X, cited in a 2016 CNBC article, found that 30% of billionaires globally do not have a bachelor's degree, meaning 70% do have at least a bachelor's degree. This is far from the 80% claim. Additionally, a Forbes analysis of the 2017 Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans showed that 84% of the top 400 wealthiest individuals in the U.S. hold a bachelor's degree or higher, with only 45 out of 400 (11.25%) being college dropouts and 23 (5.75%) never attending college. A GoCompare study of Forbes’ top 100 billionaires over 20 years found that 76% have a degree, with 47% holding a bachelor's, 23% a master's, and 6% a doctorate.
