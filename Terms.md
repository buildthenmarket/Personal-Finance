| Terms | Definitions |
| ---|--- |
| Closing date | This is the end of your billing cycle. It marks the day your credit card issuer stops recording new transactions and calculates your statement balance. This balance reflects all purchases made since the previous closing date. |
| Credit Environment |  |
| Deferment | a temporary postponement of loan payments, often with specific qualifying conditions like enrollment in school or military service, where interest may or may not accrue depending on the loan type. |
| Payment Due Date | This is the deadline by which you need to make at least the minimum payment on your outstanding balance to avoid late fees and potential interest charges. It usually falls 21-25 days after your closing date, giving you a grace period to pay off your balance in full and avoid interest. |
| Statement Date (or Issue Date) | This is typically a few days after your closing date. It's the day your credit card issuer generates your bill and sends it to you (electronically or by mail). |
| Credit Utilization |  The standard recommendation is to keep it under 30%, but under 6% is elite status. |
| accrue | It commonly refers to the buildup of interest on accounts or loans, meaning interest is being earned or owed even before it's paid. It can also indicate the accumulation of expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid, or income that has been earned but not yet received. Essentially, to accrue means that a financial value is increasing or building up, whether it's an asset or a liability. |
| Forbearance | a temporary postponement or reduction of loan payments, granted by a lender, typically during a period of financial hardship. |
