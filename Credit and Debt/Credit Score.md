# Credit Score

- One in ten adults and 50% of all 18-24 year olds are credit invisible!
- It can feel unfair because credit scores reflect circumstances beyond control (e.g., medical emergencies, unemployment), not just financial habits.

## Terms

**Consumer Reporting Agency**: A consumer reporting agency is a company that collects and provides information about consumers' creditworthiness and other relevant data to businesses for purposes such as credit granting, employment, and tenant screening.
**National Credit Bureaus**: National credit bureaus are companies that collect and maintain consumer credit information, providing reports used by lenders and other businesses to assess creditworthiness. The three major national credit bureaus in the U.S. are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

## Key Credit Score Factors:

- **Payment History (Most Influential):**
  - This is the most significant factor. It reflects whether you pay your bills on time.
  - **Positive Influence:** Consistently making on-time payments demonstrates responsible credit behavior and significantly boosts your score.
  - **Negative Influence:** Late payments, missed payments, and defaults severely damage your score. The severity of the impact increases with the length of the delinquency.
- **Credit Utilization (Highly Influential):**
  - This refers to the amount of credit you're using compared to your total available credit.
  - **Positive Influence:** Keeping your credit utilization low (ideally below 30%) shows lenders that you're not overextended.
  - **Negative Influence:** Maxing out credit cards or having high balances relative to your credit limits lowers your score.
- **Length of Credit History:**
  - A longer credit history generally results in a higher score.
  - **Positive Influence:** A long history of responsible credit use demonstrates stability.
  - **Negative Influence:** A short credit history can make it harder for lenders to assess your risk.
- **Credit Mix:**
  - This refers to the variety of credit accounts you have (e.g., credit cards, installment loans, mortgages).
  - **Positive Influence:** Having a mix of credit types shows that you can manage different types of debt.
  - **Negative Influence:** Relying solely on one type of credit may limit your score's potential.
- **New Credit:**
  - This includes recent credit applications and new accounts.
  - **Negative Influence:** Applying for multiple credit accounts in a short period can lower your score, as it may indicate financial distress.
  - Hard inquiries, which occur when lenders check your credit, can also have a small negative impact.

**Cash Flow and Payment History:**

- **Payment History and Cash Flow Connection:**
  - Your cash flow directly impacts your ability to make timely payments. Positive cash flow (more money coming in than going out) makes it easier to pay bills on time.
  - Negative cash flow (more money going out than coming in) increases the risk of late or missed payments.
- **How They Influence Your Score:**
  - **Positive Cash Flow + On-Time Payments:** This is the ideal scenario. Consistent on-time payments build a strong credit history and boost your score.
  - **Negative Cash Flow + Late/Missed Payments:** This is detrimental to your score. Late payments can stay on your credit report for years, significantly impacting your ability to obtain future credit.

**In essence:**

- Managing your cash flow is essential for maintaining a healthy payment history.
- A strong payment history is the cornerstone of a good credit score.

## the "length of credit history" factor

Closing a credit card can shorten your credit history because of how credit scoring models, like FICO and VantageScore, calculate the "length of credit history" factor, which accounts for about 15% of your FICO score. Here’s a clear explanation of why this happens, addressing your point about digital records:

1. **Credit History Length in Scoring Models**:
   - **What It Measures**: Credit scoring models look at the age of your oldest account, the average age of all your accounts, and the age of your newest account. The "average age of accounts" is particularly relevant here. When you close a credit card, it doesn’t immediately disappear from your credit report, but its status changes to "closed," and over time, it may stop contributing to your active credit history.
   - **Closed Accounts and Reporting**: Closed accounts in good standing typically remain on your credit report for 7–10 years (depending on the credit bureau—Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion). During this time, the account’s age can still positively influence your credit history length. However, once the closed account falls off your credit report (after 7–10 years), it no longer counts toward the average age of your accounts. If the closed card was one of your older accounts, its removal can significantly lower the average age, which may reduce your credit score.

2. **Why Digital Records Don’t Prevent This**:
   - **Credit Bureau Practices**: While digital records of your credit activity may exist indefinitely in some databases (like those maintained by banks or internal systems), credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) follow standardized policies for consumer credit reports. These policies dictate that closed accounts in good standing are removed from your credit report after 7–10 years to keep reports manageable and relevant. Negative information (e.g., late payments) also typically drops off after 7 years, per the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
   - **Scoring Model Focus**: Credit scoring algorithms only consider accounts currently listed on your credit report. Even if a bank has records of your account from decades ago (e.g., back to the COBOL era), those records aren’t shared with credit bureaus or factored into modern scoring models once the account falls off your report. The “COBOL era” data you mentioned might exist in legacy systems, but it’s not actively used for consumer credit scoring unless it’s still on your credit report.

3. **Impact of Closing a Card**:
   - **Immediate Effect**: Closing a card doesn’t erase its history right away. The account’s payment history and age continue to contribute to your score while it remains on your report. However, closing a card reduces your total available credit, which can increase your credit utilization ratio (a major factor, ~30% of your FICO score) if you carry balances on other cards.
   - **Long-Term Effect**: If the closed card was one of your oldest accounts, its eventual removal from your credit report (after 7–10 years) will lower the average age of your accounts. For example, if you opened a card in 1995 and another in 2020, closing the 1995 card today means that in ~2032–2035, your credit report will only reflect newer accounts, reducing your average account age and potentially your score.
   - **Example**: Suppose you have two cards: one opened 20 years ago, another 5 years ago (average age: 12.5 years). If you close the 20-year-old card, the average age drops to 5 years once it falls off your report, which could lower your score, especially if you don’t have other old accounts.

4. **Why This Matters**:
   - A longer credit history generally signals to lenders that you have more experience managing credit, making you appear less risky. Shortening your credit history by closing older accounts can make your profile look less established, even if your actual credit behavior hasn’t changed.
   - If you’re considering closing a card because its rewards are stale, consider keeping it open with minimal use (e.g., a small recurring charge paid off monthly) to preserve its contribution to your credit history. Alternatively, ask the issuer to downgrade it to a no-fee card to avoid annual costs while maintaining the account’s age.

5. **Addressing Your Point About Digital Records**:
   - You’re correct that digital records persist in many systems, and banks or issuers may retain account data indefinitely for internal purposes (e.g., fraud detection, customer history). However, credit scoring is based solely on what’s in your credit bureau file at any given time, not on every record ever created. The bureaus’ 7–10-year retention for closed accounts is a deliberate design to balance relevance with historical context, and it’s not influenced by older archival data from banks’ COBOL-based or modern systems.

**Summary**: Closing a credit card can shorten your credit history because, after 7–10 years, the closed account typically drops off your credit report and no longer counts toward the average age of your accounts in credit scoring models. While digital records of your account may exist indefinitely in some systems, credit bureaus only report closed accounts for a limited time, and scoring models only use current credit report data. To minimize impact, keep older cards open with occasional use or downgrade them to no-fee versions, especially if they’re among your oldest accounts.

### the importance of maintaining good credit habits and monitoring your credit report to safeguard your score.

1. **Utility Bills**: Late payments can negatively affect your credit score, especially if sent to collections. However, using tools like Experian Boost can help improve your score by factoring in on-time utility payments.

2. **Requests for a Credit Limit Increase**: Asking for a credit limit increase may result in a hard inquiry on your credit report, potentially lowering your score slightly, particularly if you have many recent inquiries.

3. **Business Credit Cards**: Even if a card is in your business's name, it can affect your personal credit if you're personally liable for the debt.

4. **Cosigned Loans**: If you cosign a loan and the primary borrower defaults, it can harm your credit score, as the loan appears on your credit report.

5. **Car Leases**: Lease payments are reported to credit bureaus like loans, so timely payments are essential to maintain your score.

6. **Having Little Credit Diversity**: A mix of credit types (credit cards, loans, etc.) can positively influence your score, although it is only a small part of the overall calculation.

7. **Ignoring Your Credit Report**: Regularly checking your credit report can help you catch errors or fraudulent accounts that could adversely impact your score.

## Credit Score

1. The size of your paycheck isn’t a factor in credit scoring.
2. Checking your score in Mint is a “soft pull,” which doesn’t affect your credit score.
3. Most info stays on your report for seven years—but it can have less of an impact as it ages.

## FICO Score

A FICO Score is a three-digit number that represents your creditworthiness. It's calculated based on the information in your credit report, including:

- **Payment history:** How consistently you've paid your bills on time.
- **Amounts owed:** How much you owe on your credit cards and other loans.
- **Length of credit history:** How long you've had credit accounts.
- **Credit mix:** The types of credit you have (credit cards, loans, etc.).
- **New credit:** How recently you've applied for and opened new credit accounts.

Lenders use FICO Scores to assess your risk as a borrower. A higher FICO Score generally indicates a lower risk, which can lead to better interest rates and loan terms.

Here's a general breakdown of FICO Scores:

- **Excellent:** 750-850
- **Very Good:** 700-749
- **Good:** 650-699
- **Fair:** 580-649
- **Poor:** 300-579

It's important to note that there are different versions of FICO Scores, and the specific factors that influence your score can vary. However, by understanding the factors that contribute to your FICO Score and taking steps to improve your credit habits, you can enhance your financial well-being.

### Your FICO Score could save you on car insurance

## Credit Card Usage Rate

## Having Little Credit Diversity

One thing lenders like to see is that you can successfully manage different types of credit. This means that having a credit card, auto loan, student loans and a mortgage can be better for your credit than just having a couple of credit cards.

This [credit mix](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-credit-mix-and-how-can-it-help-your-credit-score/) makes up 10% of your FICO^®^ Score. According to FICO, it likely won't be a deal breaker for lenders if you don't have tons of diversity with your credit accounts. If you're looking to take your score into 800 territory, however, adding a new type of debt to your credit mix can help.

## Credit age rating

### The age of your credit history makes up 15% of your total FICO® Score

**1. Longevity of Credit History:**

- **Positive Impact:** A longer credit history generally indicates a more responsible borrower.
- **How it's Calculated:** The average age of your credit accounts is considered, along with the age of your oldest account.

**2. Opening New Accounts:**

- **Short-term Impact:** Opening new accounts can temporarily lower your average account age, which might slightly decrease your score.
- **Long-term Benefit:** However, opening new accounts adds to your credit mix, which is another positive factor in your score. It shows that you can responsibly manage different types of credit.

**Balancing the Two:**

The key is to balance these factors:

- **Maintain Existing Accounts:** Keep older accounts open and active to maintain a long credit history.
- **Open New Accounts Strategically:** If you need new credit, open accounts responsibly and use them wisely.
- **Avoid Closing Old Accounts:** Closing old accounts can shorten your credit history, even if they have low balances or high interest rates.

**The Bottom Line:**

While opening new accounts might temporarily lower your average account age, the long-term benefits of a diverse credit mix often outweigh the short-term impact. By managing your credit responsibly and strategically, you can maintain a healthy credit score over time.

## Hard inquiries

Hard inquiries, also known as hard pulls or hard credit checks, are formal requests by lenders or creditors to review your credit report as part of a credit application process. These inquiries are typically made when you apply for:

- **Mortgages**
- **Auto loans**
- **Credit cards**
- **Personal loans**

**How do hard inquiries affect your credit score?**

- **Temporary Impact:** Hard inquiries can temporarily lower your credit score by a few points.
- **Impact Duration:** The impact is usually short-lived, lasting for about one year.
- **Multiple Inquiries:** Multiple hard inquiries within a short period can have a more significant impact on your score, as lenders may perceive it as a sign of financial instability.

**How to minimize the impact of hard inquiries:**

- **Shop around efficiently:** If you're shopping for a loan, try to complete all applications within a short timeframe (typically 45 days). Credit bureaus often group these inquiries together, reducing their impact on your score.
- **Avoid unnecessary applications:** Only apply for credit when you truly need it.
- **Monitor your credit report:** Regularly check your credit report for any unauthorized inquiries that could negatively affect your score.

While hard inquiries are a normal part of the credit application process, it's important to be mindful of their impact on your credit score. By understanding how hard inquiries work and taking steps to minimize their impact, you can maintain a healthy credit profile.
