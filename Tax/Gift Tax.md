# Gift Tax

For 2025, the gift tax annual exclusion is $19,000. You can give this amount to any number of people and the gift will be entirely excluded from the gift tax. Together, you and your spouse can give $38,000 to each person in 2025. Both spouse’s can apply their annual exclusion amounts, even if only one spouse makes the gift, but to do that the spouses must file gift tax returns electing to do so. Annual exclusion gifts entirely remove the assets (not just the appreciation thereon) from your gross estate (and the federal estate tax). Make these gifts early in the year because (to state the obvious) you can’t make them after you die. Remember, to qualify 2 for the annual exclusion, the gift must be immediately available to the recipient. When making gifts in trust, be sure the beneficiary can immediately access the gift (for example, by using a Crummey demand power). In addition to annual exclusion gifts, also consider paying tuition for your children and grandchildren directly to educational institutions, as well as paying their medical expenses directly to health care providers. There is no limit on the amount of those payments, they are not counted against your annual exclusion amount and they are also excluded from the gift tax and your gross estate.
