Understanding how tax extensions work is crucial for individual tax returns. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**What a Tax Extension Does:**

* **Extends Filing Deadline:**
    * A tax extension grants you additional time to *file* your tax return. For federal individual tax returns, this generally extends the deadline from the typical April due date to October 15th.
* **Does NOT Extend Payment Deadline:**
    * This is the most critical point. An extension gives you more time to prepare and submit your paperwork, but it does *not* give you more time to pay any taxes you owe. The original tax payment deadline remains.

**Why Taxes Are Still Due:**

* **Estimating and Paying:**
    * The IRS expects you to estimate your tax liability and pay any owed taxes by the original April deadline, even if you file for an extension.
    * If you underpay, you may be subject to penalties and interest.
* **Penalties and Interest:**
    * Failure to pay taxes owed by the original deadline can result in:
        * **Late payment penalties:** These accrue on the unpaid balance.
        * **Interest:** The IRS charges interest on unpaid tax amounts.
* **Purpose of Extension:**
    * The extension is meant to provide relief for those who need more time to gather necessary documents or complete their tax forms, not to delay tax payments.

**How to File an Extension:**

* **Form 4868:**
    * Individuals can file Form 4868, "Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return," with the IRS.
* **Electronic Filing:**
    * Many tax software programs and online services allow you to electronically file for an extension.
    * Also the IRS free file program allows for extension filing.
* **Payment with Extension:**
    * When filing for an extension, it's advisable to include any estimated tax payment to minimize potential penalties and interest.

**Key Takeaways:**

* A tax extension is for filing, not paying.
* Estimate your tax liability and pay what you owe by the original deadline.
* Filing an extension can help you avoid late-filing penalties.

I hope this helps!
