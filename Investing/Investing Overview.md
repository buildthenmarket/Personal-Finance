# Investments: The Treasure Chest

- **Stock Market**: Invest wisely in stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds. Think of the stock market as a vast, mysterious forest where fortunes can be made if you learn the paths.

- **Alternative Investments**: Look into things like venture capital, commodities, or even art if you fancy. Diversifying is like having different types of armor for different battles.

## Asset Classes

![types of assets](image.png)

Asset classes are groupings of investments that share similar characteristics and behave in a similar way in the market. They are a way to categorize investments and help investors diversify their portfolios. Here are the major asset classes:

- **Equities (Stocks):** These represent ownership shares in publicly traded companies. When you buy a stock, you're buying a piece of the company and hoping that its value will increase over time. Stocks offer the potential for high returns, but they also come with a higher degree of risk.
  ‌
- **Fixed Income (Bonds):** Bonds are essentially loans that you make to an entity, such as a corporation or government. When you buy a bond, you're essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for a fixed interest rate over a set period. Bonds are generally considered to be less risky than stocks, but they also offer lower potential returns.
  ‌
- **Cash Equivalents:** These are highly liquid investments that can be easily converted to cash with little or no loss in value. Examples of cash equivalents include money market accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and Treasury bills. Cash equivalents offer low returns, but they are a good option for investors who need easy access to their money.

- **Alternative Investments:** Alternative investments are a broad category that includes investments that don't fall into the traditional categories of stocks, bonds, cash equivalents, or real estate. Examples of alternative investments include hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital. Alternative investments can offer the potential for high returns, but they are also generally illiquid and come with a higher degree of risk.

These are just the major asset classes. There are many other sub-asset classes, and new asset classes are emerging all the time. When choosing an asset allocation for your portfolio, it's important to consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

## active vs passive asset allocation

### PASSIVE ASSET ALLOCATION

“set it and forget it” approach?

#### What is passive asset allocation?

Investors normally subscribe to the efficient market hypothesis and prefer index
funds with low turnover. The main goal is to minimize fees over the long term.

#### What risks exist with passive investing?

Predetermined set of investments that are subject to stock market risk,
concentration risk, inflation risk, and interest rate risk. Passive asset allocation
often provides less control of the investments and are overvalued.

### ACTIVE ASSET ALLOCATION

#### What is active asset allocation?

#### Investors wanting to earn higher returns in comparison to a benchmark.

Quantitative analysis is used and often those involved are said to use a
"contrarian" approach.

#### What risks exist with active investing?

Depending on the portfolio manager, potentially higher fees, increased stock
market risk from overexposure, and interest rate risk.

## low-risk phase-in strategy

Here's a low-risk phase-in strategy for an investor to systematically invest cash on the sidelines into the market:

1. Define your investment goals and risk tolerance:

- **Investment goals:** Clearly define your goals for this investment, such as retirement savings, a down payment on a house, or simply growing your wealth. Knowing your goal helps determine the investment horizon (timeframe) and risk tolerance.
- **Risk tolerance:** Assess your comfort level with potential losses. Low-risk investors prioritize capital preservation over high potential returns.

1. Choose low-risk investments:

- Focus on investment options with historically lower volatility, such as:
  - **Index funds:** These passively managed funds track a specific market index, offering broad diversification and lower fees compared to actively managed funds.
  - **Exchange-traded funds (ETFs):** Similar to index funds, ETFs trade on exchanges like stocks and offer diverse exposure to different asset classes.
  - **Investment-grade bonds:** These bonds have a lower risk of default compared to high-yield bonds, but also offer lower potential returns.
  - **Certificates of deposit (CDs):** These bank-issued savings accounts offer a fixed interest rate and guaranteed return of principal after a set maturity period.

1. Determine the phase-in period and contribution amount:

- **Phase-in period:** Consider a timeframe of 3-6 months to gradually invest your cash. This allows you to average out the cost per share (dollar-cost averaging) and potentially mitigate some impact of market volatility.
- **Contribution amount:** Divide your total investment amount by the number of months in your chosen phase-in period. This will determine the regular amount you'll invest each time.

1. Automate your investments:

- Set up a recurring investment plan with your chosen brokerage or financial institution. This automates the process, ensuring consistent contributions and minimizing emotional influences on your investment decisions.

1. Monitor and rebalance:

- Regularly monitor your portfolio performance and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation. Rebalancing helps maintain your risk tolerance by buying or selling assets to keep your portfolio aligned with your initial goals.

**Additional tips for low-risk investors:**

- **Start small and gradually increase your investment amount over time as you gain comfort.**
- **Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risk.**
- **Focus on the long term and avoid making investment decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.**
- **Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.**

Remember, this is a general framework, and it's crucial to conduct your own research and due diligence before making any investment decisions.

## What is GROWTH VS. VALUE INVESTING

Approaches in either stock or mutual fund investing. Growth investors look for companies with strong earnings. Value investors look for companies that are undervalued. Both approaches can help diversify and balance a portfolio.
