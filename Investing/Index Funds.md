## Market Indices

A market index can measure the general trends in the performance of particular market segments. You can use the appropriate market index to compare the performance (Average Annual Return) of the options in which you're invested

## Standard and Poor's 500

The S&P 500 incorporates a broad base of 500 stocks, including industrial, utility, and financial companies. Some of its stocks have a greater influence on the direction of the market. The S&P 500 calculation takes this into account by giving greater weight to these stocks. The companies that make up the S&P 500 are traded on the New York and American Stock Exchanges, as well as the Over-The-Counter Exchange.

### Morgan Stanley EAFE Index

The MSCI EAFE Index (Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, and Far East, Index) is an unmanaged index and includes the reinvestment of dividends. It is designed to represent the performance of developed stock markets outside the United States and Canada. The MSCI EAFE Index is a registered service mark of Morgan Stanley and has been licensed for use by FMR Corp.

Index funds are a popular choice for personal finance due to several advantages:

* **Diversification:**  They hold a basket of stocks or bonds, spreading your investment across multiple companies or sectors. This reduces risk compared to putting all your eggs in one basket (individual stock).
* **Low Cost:**  Index funds typically have lower expense ratios (fees) compared to actively managed funds. This means more of your return stays in your pocket.
* **Passive Management:**  Index funds track a market index, so you don't need to actively research and pick stocks. This makes them a simpler investment option.

**Risk Level:**  Index funds are generally considered **medium risk**.

* **Lower Risk than Individual Stocks:**  Diversification reduces the impact of a single company's performance on your overall investment.
* **Market Risk:**  The value of an index fund will fluctuate with the overall market. There's no guarantee of profit, but historically, the stock market has trended upwards over the long term.

**Minimum Investment:**  The minimum investment for an index fund varies depending on the provider.  Some offer low minimums (even \$1) while others might have higher requirements (around \$100 or \$500).

### providers of index funds

* **Vanguard**
* **Fidelity Investments**
* **Charles Schwab**
* **BlackRock (iShares)**

**Recommendation:**

When choosing an index fund, consider factors like your investment goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeframe.  These providers all have extensive resources and tools to help you research index funds suitable for your situation.

Here are some additional tips:

* Look for broad-market index funds, such as those tracking the S&P 500 or Total Stock Market Index.
* Consider a target-date retirement fund if you have a long-term investment horizon (like retirement). These funds automatically adjust their asset allocation (stock/bond mix) as you near retirement.

Remember, investing involves risk, and you should always do your own research before making any investment decisions.
