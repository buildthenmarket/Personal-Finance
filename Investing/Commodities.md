# Commodities

Commodities are basic materials that are used to produce other goods and services. Examples of commodities include oil, gold, and wheat. Investors can invest in commodities directly by purchasing them on a futures exchange, or they can invest in commodity funds or ETFs. Commodities can be a volatile asset class, but they can also offer a hedge against inflation.
