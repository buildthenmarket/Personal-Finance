# CDs

## How to choose a CD

Consider each part of a CD to help break down your decision:

- CD term: Most terms at a bank or credit union range from three months to five years. Learn how to choose your CD term.
- CD type: Some CDs have an unusual feature, such as a no-penalty CD that doesnâ€™t charge for early withdrawals or a bump-up CD that allows for a rate increase during a term. High-yield CDs work like standard CDs but have the best rates and are often at online banks. See types of CDs.

## Bonds

bonds are debt securities issued by governments, corporations, or other entities. When you buy a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer, who agrees to pay you interest and return your principal at a specified future date. Bonds are generally considered to be less risky than stocks, as they offer a fixed income stream and are typically less volatile.

## Fixed-income Market, AKA bond market, AKA debt securities market

The fixed-income market, also often called the bond market or debt securities market, is a marketplace where investors can buy and sell debt instruments

- **Market size:** The fixed-income market is significantly **larger** than the equity market, with a global debt market exceeding **USD 253 trillion** as of Q3 2019.
- **Risk and return:** Fixed-income investments generally offer **lower potential returns** compared to stocks but are typically considered **less risky** as well. This is because investors receive their promised interest payments and are repaid the principal amount upon maturity, assuming the issuer doesn't default.
- **Trading:** The market can be divided into two main segments:
  - **Primary market:** Where new debt instruments are issued by borrowers.
  - **Secondary market:** Where existing debt instruments are bought and sold between investors.

## Concentration risk does not affect a bond

## Municipal Bonds

Short for municipal bond, a muni is a debt security issued by a local, county, or state government. Usually, the holder of a muni bond gets certain tax exemptions on the return they generate, which makes them attractive to U.S. tax payers. To boot, the risk of default on munis tends to be low, although investors should be aware of a given muni bond's credit rating. Currently, the tax equivalent yield of munis is higher than that of Investment Grade corporate bonds.

**High-Yield Bond**: A high-yield bond, also known as a junk bond, is a type of corporate bond issued by companies with lower credit ratings (typically below BBB- or Baa3) from established credit rating agencies. These bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate investors for the increased risk of default, as companies with lower credit ratings are more likely to struggle with debt repayment. High-yield bonds are often used by startup companies or capital-intensive firms with high debt ratios to raise capital.

**Zero-Coupon Bond**: A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not make regular interest payments. Instead, the bond is sold at a discount to its face value and the investor receives the full face value at maturity, earning a return solely from the difference between the purchase price and the redemption value.

**Running Yield**: The running yield is a measure of a bond's return or yield each year, represented as a percentage of the bond's current market value or price. This calculation is useful for investors who want to evaluate the current return on their bond holdings.

**Effective Yield**: The effective yield is the total yield an investor receives, taking into account the power of compounding on investment returns. It differs from the nominal yield, which is the stated interest rate of the bond's coupon.

**Yield to Maturity (YTM)**: Yield to Maturity is the average yield or return that an investor can expect from an issue each year, assuming they purchase it at its market value and hold it until maturity.

**Yield to Call (YTC)**: Yield to Call is the return an investor can expect if a bond is called (repurchased) by the issuer before its maturity date.

**Yield to Worst (YTW)**: Yield to Worst is the lowest yield an investor can expect from a bond, considering all possible scenarios, including early redemption, default, or maturity.

## core fixed income portfolio

A core fixed income portfolio is a type of bond investment strategy that aims to provide investors with a balance of income, capital preservation, and stability. It is designed to be a low-risk investment option, and is often used as a foundation for a diversified portfolio.

Here are some key characteristics of core fixed income portfolios:

- **Investment in investment-grade bonds:** Core fixed income portfolios typically invest in investment-grade bonds, which are bonds that have been rated by a credit rating agency as being of high quality and relatively low risk of default.
- **Diversification across sectors:** Core fixed income portfolios are diversified across different sectors of the fixed income market, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and securitized products. This diversification helps to reduce the risk of the portfolio.
- **Focus on total return:** Core fixed income portfolios aim to provide investors with total return, which includes both income from the bonds and capital appreciation from the bonds' prices.
- **Active management:** Core fixed income portfolios are typically actively managed by professional investment managers who research the bond market and select bonds that they believe will offer good value.

Here are some of the benefits of investing in a core fixed income portfolio:

- **Provides income:** Core fixed income portfolios can provide investors with a steady stream of income from the interest payments on the bonds.
- **Preserves capital:** Core fixed income portfolios are designed to be relatively low-risk, which can help to preserve investors' capital.
- **Offers stability:** Core fixed income portfolios can help to provide stability to a portfolio, especially during periods of market volatility.

## aggregate bond

an **aggregate bond** refers to a type of bond index that represents the total U.S. investment-grade bond market. It is a broad-based benchmark that measures the performance of the U.S. dollar-denominated, fixed-rate, taxable bond market.

More specifically, an aggregate bond index typically includes:

1. U.S. Treasuries
2. Government-sponsored securities (e.g., Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae)
3. Highly rated corporate bonds from blue-chip issuers
4. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
5. Asset-backed securities (ABS)
6. Municipal bonds

The Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index, also known as the "Agg," is a widely followed benchmark that tracks the performance of this broad range of investment-grade bonds. It is used by investors and fund managers to gauge their portfolio performance against a comprehensive standard, enabling them to determine how well their investments are performing relative to the broader market.

In a legal context, an aggregate bond can also refer to a single bond that covers multiple charges or counts in a criminal case, as mentioned in the Justia Ask a Lawyer snippet.

In summary, an aggregate bond can refer to either:

1. A bond index that represents the total U.S. investment-grade bond market, or
2. A single bond that covers multiple charges or counts in a criminal case.

**Note:** The term "aggregate bond" is not a specific type of bond with a unique structure or characteristics, but rather a term used to describe a broad-based bond index or a single bond covering multiple charges.
