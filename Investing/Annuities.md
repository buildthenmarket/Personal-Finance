# ANNUITY

An annuity is a financial contract with an insurance company, typically in retirement. It provides a stream of income, and an annuity can be held within an IRA, or it can be a seperate financial product. So an IRA can hold an annuity as an investment.

## Definition

**Annuities**: An annuity is a financial product that provides a guaranteed income stream for a set period of time or for life. Annuities are generally considered to be low-risk investments, as they offer a guaranteed income stream and are typically backed by insurance companies. However, it's important to carefully evaluate the terms and fees associated with any annuity product before investing.

## ANNUITY AS BOND SUBSTITUTE

### What types of annuities can be used?

Almost all types including immediate, Multi-year Guaranteed Annuities
(MYGAs), indexed, and variable annuities. However, variable ones shouldn't be
used.

### How should an annuity be positioned?

MYGAs are purchased for a set amount of years (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, or more).
Immediate annuities as well as indexed, and variable annuities with an income
rider are for income needs.

## Principle Protection

In the context of annuities, the principle protection refers to a feature or guarantee provided by certain types of annuity contracts. It is designed to protect the initial investment or principal amount you contribute to the annuity from market downturns or investment losses.

With principle protection, the insurance company issuing the annuity guarantees that your principal will be preserved regardless of how the underlying investments perform. This means that even if the investments within the annuity experience losses, your initial contribution will be returned to you in full at the end of the contract term or upon your death, depending on the specific terms of the annuity.

Principle protection is commonly associated with fixed annuities and indexed annuities. In a fixed annuity, your principal is typically guaranteed, and the insurance company is responsible for managing the investment risk. In an indexed annuity, the principal protection feature ensures that your initial investment is not subject to market losses, while still allowing for potential gains based on the performance of an underlying index.

It's important to note that principle protection usually comes at a cost. Annuity contracts with principle protection features may have lower potential returns compared to other investment options, as the insurance company assumes the risk of market fluctuations. Additionally, fees and charges associated with annuities can vary, so it's crucial to carefully review and understand the terms and conditions before purchasing an annuity with principle protection.
