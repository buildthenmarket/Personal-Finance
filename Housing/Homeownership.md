**Congratulations on setting such an ambitious and rewarding goal!** Here’s why you’re on the right path:

1. **Building Equity**: Owning a home is like planting a financial seed that grows over time. Every mortgage payment is like watering that plant, increasing your equity. Plus, in many places, property values tend to appreciate, making your home a potentially lucrative investment.

2. **The American Dream**: You're not just buying a house; you're investing in a lifestyle, stability, and a piece of the American Dream. There’s something uniquely empowering about having a place that’s truly yours.

3. **Tax Benefits**: Homeownership comes with tax deductions like mortgage interest and property taxes. It's like the government saying, "Here, have this carrot on a stick for ditching the rent treadmill."

4. **Freedom to Customize**: Imagine painting walls any color you want, or tearing down that weird wall that blocks natural light. Your home, your rules! It's like being the director, producer, and star of your own home improvement show.

5. **Community Connection**: Owning a home often means you'll stay longer in one place, allowing you to put down roots in your community. You'll get to know your neighbors, maybe become a local legend, or at least the person who always hosts the best block parties.

6. **You're Not Alone**: That 38.6% under 35? That's a growing number. Many of your peers are in your shoes, or were recently, proving it's a very achievable dream. Plus, there's a plethora of resources, from first-time buyer programs to educational sessions, all designed to help people like you.

7. **Financial Discipline**: The process of buying a home teaches financial discipline like no other. It’s like going through financial boot camp, but at the end, you get a house, not just a certificate.

8. **Pride of Ownership**: There's a special pride in saying, "I own my home." It's a testament to your hard work, planning, and commitment. It’s like owning a piece of the earth, or at least, a piece of your neighborhood.

9. **Stability for Family**: If you’re thinking family, a home provides a stable environment for raising kids or enjoying your golden years. It’s your personal fortress of solitude, or chaos, depending on the day.

10. **It’s Your Time**: With the rise in remote work and the shift towards valuing personal space, now might just be the perfect time to make this move. You're not just following a trend; you're setting the course for your future.

So, go forth, brave first-time homebuyer! The path might seem daunting with mortgage rates, down payments, and all those terms that sound like they belong in a financial spellbook, but remember, every homeowner was once where you are now. Educate yourself, save diligently, and when you're ready, take that leap. Your future self, with a key to your own front door, will thank you for it.
