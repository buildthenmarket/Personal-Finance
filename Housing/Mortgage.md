| short sale | If you’re interested in [buying a house](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/how-to-buy-a-house "‌") at a discount, short sales can be an appealing option. Short sales are a safer alternative to foreclosures for both sellers and their lenders, which is why you often can find them priced just below market value. They’re also often in better condition than [distressed properties](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/distressed-property "‌"). However, a short sale transaction is far more complex than your average sale, and can therefore involve a lot more risk. Before you decide to purchase a short sale, you must know precisely what you’re getting yourself into. |

## HELOC strategy / Velocity banking

Also known as the “HELOC strategy,” this somewhat risky approach involves using a line of credit—typically a home equity line of credit (HELOC)—as a savings or checking account to pay for your monthly expenses _and_ make principal payments on a loan, usually a mortgage. According to [Money](https://money.com/youtube-mortgage-payoff-velocity-banking/ "‌"), “The basic idea is to strategically spread your money across different debt products in order to minimize interest payments and maximize the amount going to pay down your mortgage principal.”

This strategy will only work when you spend less than you earn, have sufficient disposable income to make monthly principal (not just interest) payments on your mortgage or other loan—and you can trust yourself to manage debt and excess cash flow responsibly. (This approach is _not_ for people who have a track record of spending more than they earn and wracking up evermore debt.)

Some argue that with mortgage interests rates being low, a more lucrative approach is to use the HELOC to pay for your monthly expenses, then _investing_ your disposable income in the stock market and other retirement accounts.
