## Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)

### How are assets divided?

- Employer sponsored plans or pensions require a "Qualified Domestic Relations Order" (QDRO) to divide the plan in a divorce. (I.R.C. 5 414(p)(1)(B). (2021).) It doesn't matter whether a judge decides how the accounts will be split, or the spouses come to an agreement—on their own or with the aid of mediation. Either way, they'll still have to get a QDRO.
- You don't need a QDRO to divide an IRA. However, taxes will need to be paid on the transfer of IRA funds from one spouse to another unless it meets the requirements for a "transfer of account incident to divorce." (I.R.C. 5 408(d)(6).)
- If either spouse has been in the U.S. military long enough to qualify for a pension, be aware that there are complex rules that control dividing military pensions.

## State Property Equitable Distribution Laws

Dividing property during a divorce hinges on whether your state follows community property or equitable distribution laws. Here's a breakdown of both:

- **Community Property:** In these states, all property acquired during the marriage is considered jointly owned by both spouses, regardless of who earned the money to buy it. This is called community property. When spouses divorce in community property states, marital assets are typically divided equally. There are some exceptions for inheritance or gifts received by one spouse during the marriage.
- **Equitable Distribution:** Most states, including New Jersey, follow equitable distribution. Here, property is divided fairly, but not necessarily equally, between the spouses. This means the court will consider factors like the length of the marriage, the income of each spouse, and the contributions each spouse made to acquiring the property to determine a fair division.

**Separate Property:** Under both community property and equitable distribution, there is such a thing as separate property. This includes:

- Assets acquired before the marriage
- Inheritances received by one spouse during the marriage
- Gifts received by one spouse during the marriage (with some exceptions)

Each spouse generally gets to keep their separate property after a divorce. However, things can get complicated if separate property gets commingled with marital property. For instance, if you inherit money before the marriage and deposit it into a joint bank account during the marriage, it might become marital property.

## personal goodwill

In divorce settlements, personal goodwill refers to the intangible value associated with an individual's skills, experience, and reputation within their field. It's essentially the increased earning potential someone has due to their own capabilities, separate from the value of a business itself.

Here's a breakdown of how personal goodwill is treated in divorces:

- **Not Considered Divisible Asset:** Unlike marital assets that can be divided during a divorce, personal goodwill is typically not directly divided between spouses. It's more like a future earning capacity than a tangible asset.
- **Impact on Property Division & Alimony:** While not directly divided, a spouse's personal goodwill can still be a factor in determining a fair property division and alimony awards. For example, if one spouse's career success significantly increased marital assets during the marriage due to their personal goodwill, it might influence how other assets are divided. Similarly, a spouse's higher earning potential due to personal goodwill could be considered when determining alimony.
- **Differentiation from Enterprise Goodwill:** It's important to distinguish personal goodwill from enterprise goodwill. Enterprise goodwill refers to the intangible value of a business itself, built on factors like customer base, location, and brand recognition. In some cases, enterprise goodwill might be considered marital property and subject to division during divorce.
