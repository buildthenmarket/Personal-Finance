## Average Length of US Marriages and Divorces

Based on the provided search results, here's an explanation of the psychology behind the average 7-year duration for friendships and 8-year duration for marriages in the United States:

**Friendships (7 years):**

1. **Socialization and bonding**: Friendships often begin with shared experiences, common interests, or social connections. As individuals spend time together, they develop emotional bonds and a sense of belonging. After 7 years, these bonds may start to weaken due to changes in life circumstances, such as:
	* Career shifts or promotions, leading to differing schedules and priorities.
	* Moving to new locations, making it harder to maintain regular interactions.
	* Changes in personal values or interests, causing friends to drift apart.
2. **Drift and differentiation**: Friendships naturally undergo a process of drift and differentiation, where individuals grow and evolve separately. As people mature, their interests, values, and lifestyles may diverge, making it challenging to maintain the same level of closeness.
3. **Lack of formal commitment**: Friendships typically lack the formal commitment and expectations that come with romantic relationships or marriages. Without explicit agreements or rituals, friendships may not have the same level of investment or maintenance, leading to a natural decline over time.

**Marriages (8 years):**

1. **Romantic infatuation and adjustment**: Marriages often begin with intense romantic feelings, which gradually give way to a more stable, long-term partnership. The initial excitement and novelty wear off, and couples must adapt to each other's quirks, habits, and differences.
2. **Couples' growth and change**: As individuals grow and evolve, their needs, desires, and expectations may shift. Marriages require ongoing effort and communication to navigate these changes and maintain a sense of connection.
3. **Inertia and complacency**: After several years, couples may fall into a pattern of complacency, taking each other for granted. Without intentional effort to maintain the relationship, the spark and excitement can fade, leading to a natural decline in satisfaction and ultimately, divorce.
4. **Social and cultural pressures**: Societal expectations and cultural norms can influence marriage duration. For example, the "7-year itch" phenomenon, where couples experience a decline in satisfaction around the 7-year mark, may be exacerbated by external pressures, such as:
	* Changing family dynamics (e.g., having children).
	* Career demands and stress.
	* Social media comparisons and unrealistic relationship expectations.

Keep in mind that these explanations are generalizations and may not apply to every individual or couple. Factors like personal characteristics, relationship quality, and external circumstances can significantly influence the duration of friendships and marriages.

## Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)

### How are assets divided?

- Employer sponsored plans or pensions require a "Qualified Domestic Relations Order" (QDRO) to divide the plan in a divorce. (I.R.C. 5 414(p)(1)(B). (2021).) It doesn't matter whether a judge decides how the accounts will be split, or the spouses come to an agreement—on their own or with the aid of mediation. Either way, they'll still have to get a QDRO.
- You don't need a QDRO to divide an IRA. However, taxes will need to be paid on the transfer of IRA funds from one spouse to another unless it meets the requirements for a "transfer of account incident to divorce." (I.R.C. 5 408(d)(6).)
- If either spouse has been in the U.S. military long enough to qualify for a pension, be aware that there are complex rules that control dividing military pensions.

## State Property Equitable Distribution Laws

Dividing property during a divorce hinges on whether your state follows community property or equitable distribution laws. Here's a breakdown of both:

- **Community Property:** In these states, all property acquired during the marriage is considered jointly owned by both spouses, regardless of who earned the money to buy it. This is called community property. When spouses divorce in community property states, marital assets are typically divided equally. There are some exceptions for inheritance or gifts received by one spouse during the marriage.
- **Equitable Distribution:** Most states, including New Jersey, follow equitable distribution. Here, property is divided fairly, but not necessarily equally, between the spouses. This means the court will consider factors like the length of the marriage, the income of each spouse, and the contributions each spouse made to acquiring the property to determine a fair division.

**Separate Property:** Under both community property and equitable distribution, there is such a thing as separate property. This includes:

- Assets acquired before the marriage
- Inheritances received by one spouse during the marriage
- Gifts received by one spouse during the marriage (with some exceptions)

Each spouse generally gets to keep their separate property after a divorce. However, things can get complicated if separate property gets commingled with marital property. For instance, if you inherit money before the marriage and deposit it into a joint bank account during the marriage, it might become marital property.

## personal goodwill

In divorce settlements, personal goodwill refers to the intangible value associated with an individual's skills, experience, and reputation within their field. It's essentially the increased earning potential someone has due to their own capabilities, separate from the value of a business itself.

Here's a breakdown of how personal goodwill is treated in divorces:

- **Not Considered Divisible Asset:** Unlike marital assets that can be divided during a divorce, personal goodwill is typically not directly divided between spouses. It's more like a future earning capacity than a tangible asset.
- **Impact on Property Division & Alimony:** While not directly divided, a spouse's personal goodwill can still be a factor in determining a fair property division and alimony awards. For example, if one spouse's career success significantly increased marital assets during the marriage due to their personal goodwill, it might influence how other assets are divided. Similarly, a spouse's higher earning potential due to personal goodwill could be considered when determining alimony.
- **Differentiation from Enterprise Goodwill:** It's important to distinguish personal goodwill from enterprise goodwill. Enterprise goodwill refers to the intangible value of a business itself, built on factors like customer base, location, and brand recognition. In some cases, enterprise goodwill might be considered marital property and subject to division during divorce.
