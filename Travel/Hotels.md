## Booking a Hotel at Night

Booking a hotel at late night in big tourist cities can be challenging due to the high demand and limited availability. However, there are several strategies you can use to secure a room:

- **Contact the Hotel Directly**: The easiest and most effective way is to call the hotel directly. This allows you to speak with a real person who can often make exceptions to hotel rules and accommodate your needs. Have your arrival and departure information ready when you call.
  
- **Reset Your Device Clock**: If you prefer to book online, you can reset the clock on your smart device to a time earlier than midnight. This can sometimes allow you to make a reservation through the hotel's online system. However, this method is less reliable than contacting the hotel directly.

- **Inform the Hotel About Your Late Arrival**: If you know you will be arriving late, it's a good idea to inform the hotel in advance. This ensures they will hold your room for you and can prepare for your late check-in.

- **Negotiate a Rate**: When contacting the hotel, you can negotiate a rate based on the fact that you are checking in so late. Hotels may be willing to offer a discounted rate to secure your booking.

- **Check Hotel Policies**: Before booking, review the hotel's check-in policies. Some hotels have specific times for check-in and may require late arrivals to contact them directly.
