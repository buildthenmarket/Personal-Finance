## Dave Ramsey’s 7 Baby Steps

No financial strategy roundup would be complete without mention of Dave Ramsey. Love or hate him, his reach and influence as a best-selling author and radio show host can’t be denied. Here are Ramsey’s “7 Baby Steps” to living debt-free:

1. Save $1,000 for a starter emergency fund.

1. Pay off debt (except your house) using Ramsey’s controversial “

[Snowball Method](https://www.debt.org/advice/debt-snowball-method-how-it-works/ "‌")” of attacking the smallest debts first (regardless of interest rates on larger debt amounts).

1. Build out your starter emergency fund with enough to pay for 3 to 6 months worth of expenses.

1. Invest 15% of your income in your employer’s 401(k) plan and Roth IRAs.

1. Save “as much as possible” for your child’s college, in Educational Savings Accounts (ESAs) and 529 tax-advantaged savings plans.

1. Pay off your mortgage.

1. Build wealth and donate.

## Bogleheads

Named after Vanguard Group founder John Bogle, this strategy advocates for saving at least 20% of your income, investing early and often, never trying to “time the market,” finding a risk profile that is not too high _or_ too low, investing in broadly diversified low-cost (low expense ratio) index funds, and staying the course through the stock market’s ups and downs (i.e., not selling the minute you smell a bear market).

In his speech “[Investing with Simplicity](http://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Investing-with-Simplicity-1-30-99.pdf "‌")” Bogle said, “Simplicity is the master key to financial success.” Rather than doing extensive research on and tracking of individual stocks, advocate achieving portfolio diversification by following a simple investing philosophy: the creation of a three-fund “lazy” portfolio that includes a total stock market index fund, a total international stock index fund, and a total bond market fund (a percentage that Bogle recommends should be equivalent to your age—if you’re 40, allocate 40% of your portfolio to bonds). Then, outside of periodic rebalancing, set it, forget it, and watch your money produce returns with the market over time.

## Personal Finance Terms and Strategies

1. **Zero-Based Budgeting:**
   * A budgeting method where every dollar is allocated to specific expenses, savings, or debt repayment, leaving a balance of zero. This approach ensures that you are intentional with your spending.

2. **50/30/20 Rule:**
   * A simple budgeting guideline that suggests allocating 50% of your income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings or debt repayment. This balance can promote financial stability and happiness.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   * A savings fund set aside for unexpected expenses. Having an emergency fund can provide peace of mind and reduce stress during financial uncertainties.

4. **Mindful Spending:**
   * Being conscious of your spending habits and making intentional choices about purchases. This practice encourages spending on things that genuinely bring joy and satisfaction.

5. **Cash Envelopes:**
   * A physical budgeting method where cash is allocated to different spending categories (e.g., groceries, entertainment) in separate envelopes. Once the cash is gone, no more spending occurs in that category.

6. **Sinking Funds:**
   * Savings set aside for specific future expenses (e.g., vacations, holidays, car repairs). This strategy helps avoid financial stress when these expenses arise.

7. **Needs vs. Wants Analysis:**
   * A practice of distinguishing between essential expenses (needs) and discretionary spending (wants). This clarity can help prioritize spending and enhance satisfaction.

8. **Spending Freeze:**
   * A temporary halt on non-essential spending to focus on saving or paying down debt. This can create a sense of financial control and relief.

9. **Gratitude Journaling:**
   * Keeping a journal to note things you are thankful for, particularly related to your finances. This practice can enhance happiness and perspective on what you have versus what you want.

10. **Value-Based Spending:**
    * Aligning your spending with your personal values and priorities. This approach fosters a sense of fulfillment by ensuring that your money goes towards what truly matters to you.

### Summary

Implementing these personal finance strategies can help create a healthier relationship with money, reduce financial stress, and enhance overall happiness in daily life. By focusing on intentional budgeting and mindful spending, you can achieve greater peace of mind and satisfaction with your financial decisions.

## Risk

**Risk tolerance**: the willingness to take risk
**Risk capacity**: the ability to take risk
**Risk required**: the level of risk required to meet a particular goal

## There's a lot of truth to the statement "you can't budget your way out of poverty." Here's why

* **Limited resources:**  When your income barely covers basic needs like food and rent, there's little room for budgeting to create a significant surplus. Cutting corners can only go so far.
* **Systemic factors:** Poverty often goes hand-in-hand with low wages, lack of access to education or healthcare, and discrimination. Budgeting can't fix these underlying issues.
* **Unexpected costs:**  Life throws curveballs. Even a small car repair or medical bill can derail a tight budget for someone in poverty.

However, budgeting isn't entirely useless. It can help:

* **Gain control:**  Understanding where your money goes empowers you to make informed choices, even with limited resources.
* **Stretch your income:**  Finding ways to save on groceries, transportation, or utilities can free up a little extra cash.
* **Build financial literacy:**  Budgeting is a skill that can benefit you throughout your life, even if it doesn't solve poverty on its own.

So, it's more accurate to say that budgeting alone can't eradicate poverty. But it can be a helpful tool alongside efforts to address the root causes of poverty, like job training, affordable housing initiatives, and a living wage.  

## US Class Distinctions and Income Brackets

Classism in personal finance

A cynic might scoff at "life is what you make of it" because it oversimplifies complex realities. The phrase implies personal effort alone shapes outcomes, ignoring systemic barriers, luck, or circumstances beyond control—like economic hardship, health issues, or social inequities. To them, it sounds like naive optimism or a dismissive platitude, blaming individuals for systemic failures. Sarcasm would be their way of rejecting this perceived oversimplification, mocking the idea that sheer willpower can conquer all obstacles.

**1. Assumptions about resources and starting points:**

* **"Pull yourself up by your bootstraps" mentality:** Many personal finance narratives assume a baseline level of income, savings, and access to resources that simply isn't a reality for everyone. Advice often focuses on saving for retirement, investing in the stock market, or buying a home, which are difficult or impossible without disposable income and a stable financial foundation.
* **Ignoring systemic barriers:** Financial advice often overlooks the systemic inequalities (like stagnant wages, predatory lending in low-income areas, and unequal access to education and healthcare) that disproportionately affect people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This can make it seem like financial struggles are purely due to individual choices, rather than broader societal issues.
* **"Knowledge of the Hidden Rules of Social Class":** Some frameworks highlight that different social classes operate with different "hidden rules" regarding money, work, and social interactions. Personal finance advice often implicitly assumes a middle-class or upper-class understanding of these rules, making it less accessible or even irrelevant to those from different backgrounds.

**2. Focus on specific types of clients/assets:**

* **High net worth bias:** Traditional financial advising often caters to individuals with significant assets, as this is where advisors earn higher fees. This leaves many people with lower incomes or less wealth underserved or feeling like financial advice isn't "for them."
* **Exclusionary language and jargon:** Financial advice can be filled with complex jargon and concepts that are intimidating and difficult to understand for those without a financial background. This can create a barrier to entry for many.

**3. Lack of representation and trust:**

* **Homogenous financial advisor demographics:** The financial advising industry has historically lacked diversity. People from marginalized backgrounds may find it difficult to connect with advisors who don't understand their unique experiences or who come from a different socioeconomic reality. This can lead to a lack of trust in financial institutions and advisors.
* **Impact of historical discrimination:** Historically, certain groups have been excluded from financial systems or subjected to discriminatory practices (e.g., redlining). This history impacts current trust and access to financial services.

**4. Advice that isn't universally applicable:**

* **Budgeting advice:** While well-intentioned, advice to "cut out your daily latte" can be tone-deaf and unhelpful for someone struggling to afford basic necessities. For many, there's no "fat" to trim in their budget.
* **Investment strategies:** Complex investment strategies presented in books or by advisors may not be appropriate or accessible for those with limited capital or who prioritize immediate financial stability over long-term growth.
* **Debt management:** Advice on debt often doesn't differentiate between "good debt" (like a mortgage) and "bad debt" (like high-interest credit card debt) or acknowledge the structural reasons people accrue debt (e.g., medical emergencies, lack of living wage).

**Examples in books and media:**

While many personal finance books aim to be helpful, some are criticized for:

* **"Rich Dad Poor Dad"**: This book has been critiqued for its anecdotal and sometimes oversimplified advice, and for promoting real estate speculation without adequately addressing the risks or the initial capital required, potentially perpetuating a "get rich quick" mentality that isn't feasible for everyone.
* **Generic budgeting guides:** Some books offer one-size-fits-all budgeting templates that don't account for varying income levels, essential expenses, or financial emergencies common in lower-income households.

In conclusion, while the intention of personal finance advising is often to empower individuals, the underlying assumptions, accessibility issues, and historical context can lead to classist outcomes that reinforce existing wealth disparities. Addressing classism requires a more nuanced, inclusive, and systemic approach to financial education and advising.

You're touching upon a widely discussed idea, often summarized by the saying "shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations." This proverb suggests that it typically takes three generations for a family to lose the wealth accumulated by the first generation.

Here's a breakdown of why this "reset" can happen:

**The Builder Generation:**

* **Grit and Sacrifice:** The first generation usually builds wealth through hard work, determination, and often significant personal sacrifice. They have a deep understanding of the value of money because they earned it.
* **Direct Connection to Effort:** They have a strong connection between their labor and their financial success.

**The Steward Generation:**

* **Familiarity but Less Direct Experience:** The second generation often grows up with some awareness of their parents' struggles and the effort involved in creating the wealth. They may have witnessed the sacrifices firsthand.
* **Comfort and Entitlement:** However, they also experience a more comfortable lifestyle and may develop a sense of entitlement simply by virtue of their inheritance.
* **Potential for Poor Management:** Without the same drive or understanding of wealth creation, they might not manage the wealth as effectively, sometimes due to lack of financial literacy or a different set of priorities.

**The Consumer Generation:**

* **Distance from Origin:** The third generation is often the furthest removed from the source of the wealth. They have typically grown up in affluence without experiencing the hardships or understanding the principles that led to its creation.
* **Lack of Appreciation:** They may take the wealth for granted and lack a true appreciation for its value and the effort required to maintain it.
* **Dilution through Inheritance:** As the family grows, the original wealth is often divided among more and more descendants, naturally diluting each individual's share.
* **Different Priorities and Lifestyles:** Their values and lifestyles may differ significantly from the wealth-building generations, leading to spending habits that deplete the inheritance.
* **Lack of Financial Acumen:** They may not have been taught or may not prioritize learning how to manage and grow the wealth effectively.

**However, it's crucial to understand that this "three-generation curse" is not an absolute rule.** Many families successfully preserve and grow their wealth beyond three generations. Here are some factors that can help break this cycle:

* **Financial Education and Literacy:** Educating subsequent generations about wealth management, investing, and the importance of financial responsibility is key.
* **Strong Family Values and Communication:** Establishing clear family values around wealth and fostering open communication about finances can help align goals and expectations.
* **Professional Guidance:** Engaging financial advisors, estate planners, and other professionals can provide expertise in managing and transferring wealth effectively.
* **Instilling a Strong Work Ethic and Purpose:** Encouraging each generation to find their own passions and develop a strong work ethic, independent of the inherited wealth, can provide a sense of purpose and prevent complacency.
* **Creating a Shared Family Legacy:** Focusing on the long-term vision for the family's wealth and instilling a sense of stewardship rather than ownership can encourage responsible management.
* **Strategic Philanthropy:** Engaging in philanthropy can provide a sense of purpose and connect the family's wealth to a larger societal impact.
* **Careful Estate Planning:** Implementing robust estate plans that consider tax implications and provide clear guidelines for wealth transfer can help preserve assets.

So, while there's a historical tendency for wealth to diminish over three generations due to the factors mentioned, it's not an inevitable outcome. With careful planning, education, and a focus on long-term stewardship, families can certainly buck this trend.

## Clickbait claim > 80% of billionaires never went to college

Research from Wealth-X, cited in a 2016 CNBC article, found that 30% of billionaires globally do not have a bachelor's degree, meaning 70% do have at least a bachelor's degree. This is far from the 80% claim. Additionally, a Forbes analysis of the 2017 Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans showed that 84% of the top 400 wealthiest individuals in the U.S. hold a bachelor's degree or higher, with only 45 out of 400 (11.25%) being college dropouts and 23 (5.75%) never attending college. A GoCompare study of Forbes’ top 100 billionaires over 20 years found that 76% have a degree, with 47% holding a bachelor's, 23% a master's, and 6% a doctorate.
