## Determining the credibility of smaller and local banks

Determining the credibility of smaller and local banks in the US can be an important step in making sure your money is safe and secure. Here are some ways to evaluate the credibility of a smaller or local bank:

1. Check for FDIC insurance: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank. Make sure the bank is FDIC-insured, which you can check by looking for the FDIC logo on the bank's website or by visiting the FDIC's BankFind tool.
2. Look for a state banking license: Smaller and local banks are typically chartered by state banking authorities. You can check with your state banking authority to confirm that the bank is licensed and in good standing.
3. Check the bank's financial health: You can review a bank's financial statements and other regulatory filings on the FDIC's website or by requesting them directly from the bank. Look for indicators of financial strength, such as a high capital ratio and low levels of nonperforming loans.
4. Research the bank's history and reputation: Look for news articles or other information about the bank's history and reputation. Check online reviews and ratings from other customers to get a sense of the bank's customer service and satisfaction levels.
5. Evaluate the bank's product and service offerings: Look at the bank's product and service offerings to make sure they meet your needs. Consider factors such as fees, interest rates, and account features.
6. Talk to the bank's employees: Consider visiting the bank and talking to its employees to get a sense of their knowledge, professionalism, and customer service skills.

By taking these steps, you can help ensure that the smaller or local bank you choose is reputable and trustworthy, and that your money is safe and secure.
