- **Decentralization and Censorship Resistance**: Unlike many Layer 2 solutions, such as rollups on Ethereum, which rely on a single smart contract or operator node, the Lightning Network allows users to run their own nodes and manage their own payment channels. This means that even if one user is censored or exploited, the rest of the network remains functional, enhancing its decentralization and resistance to censorship.

- **Competitive Routing**: Routing nodes on the Lightning Network compete with each other to provide stable and competitively priced payment forwarding. This competition ensures that users can find the most efficient and cost-effective routes for their transactions, similar to how a competitive market for mining secures Layer 1 networks.

- **Scalability**: The Lightning Network can support a virtually unlimited number of payment channels, enabling anyone to transact with anyone else on the network. This scalability addresses Bitcoin's scalability issues, providing fast and low-cost transactions without compromising on security or decentralization.

- **Security and Trustlessness**: The Lightning Network builds on the security and trustlessness of Bitcoin, allowing for trustless payments as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. This means that users can transact with confidence, knowing that the network's design prioritizes security and decentralization.
